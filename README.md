Twitter contests are a great marketing tool. They create engagement and promote content while rewarding participants. However, **trust is often an issue**. Winners can be chosen arbitrarily, raising doubts about fairness. In some cases, the prize may never be distributed at all, further damaging trust.

This is where blockchain can be leveraged to ensure transparent prize distribution. Smart contract allow contest creators to define strict and unchangeable rules. It can defines how participant can be selected, a fair randomly choose of the winner and how prizes are distributed. Everything is automated, traceable, and free from manipulation. No more opaque decisions and no more blocked rewards.

## How it works

Anyone can create a contest by providing a tweet URL and specifying a prize. To participate, users must first verify Twitter account ownership via a ZK proof generated through VLayer. Once verified, users can join the contest by reacting and quoting the contest tweet. A second ZK proof is generated via VLayer to confirm participation.

After the contest ends, a winner is selected randomly using a number generated by Pyth Network. If the prize is in a custom token, Pyth Price Feeds are used to display its USD equivalent, ensuring clarity on prize value. Finally, the selected winner can directly claim their prize.
